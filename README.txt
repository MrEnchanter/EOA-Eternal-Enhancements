Description : This is a collection of basically every single trick in the book for adding enhanced visuals to Doom,
without a single new graphic of any kind being used. This is composed entirely of GZDoom text lumps, such as
decorate, gldefs, texture defs, and terrain defs. 
The following new visual enhancements are included:
 - Enhanced particle effects for explosive barrels, featuring smoke rising, nukage splashing, and green flames
 - Enhanced particle effects for rocket explosions, featuring sparks, smoke, and burnt chunks of debris
 - Enhanced particle effects for fireballs, featuring smoke, trailing flames, and explosive fiery impacts
 - Enhanced particle effects for plasma blasts, featuring crackling electricity mixed with brightly color smoke
 - Deep liquid (floor clipping) for water, nukage, blood, mud/slime, and lava
 - Smoothed out animations for all flat liquid plus warp effects
 - Smoothed out multi-layered animations for all liquid falls (including lava falls for megawads that use them)
 - Randomized frame speeds for animated textures that feature fire or liquids dripping
 - Smoothed animations for the glowing red rock wall textures
 - Certain textures are now brightmapped by using themselves as their own brightmaps
 - FIREBLU iS nOw PsYcHeDeLiC!
 - Glow settings for many flats to simulate things like light fixtures casting light, liquids giving off light, and
certain environments just having their own coloration similar to Playstation Doom.

SPECIAL THANKS TO...
- Z86 for his "Particle Fire Enhancer" mod, which taught me about spawning particles in all sorts of different 
ways to achieve different visual effects.
- Gifty for Smooth Textures, which was instrumental in providing a jumping off point for some parts
of this mod and inspiratin for others.
- Kazudra & Jakie for their "Subtle Lighting" and "More Lights" mods, which I learned about texture glows from.
- Rachael for her "Smooth Liquids" resource post, which taught me about creating custom animated textures 
and also gave me the idea to see how much I could do without the need for new graphics, thus inspiring this 
whole mod in the first place.
- The ZDoom Wiki, which I spent so much time on it probably constitutes half of the time I spent working on this.

Additional Credits to : Anyone who has ever created a resource for GZDoom, written a forum post explaining 
something over on the ZDoom forums,, or worked on an article in the ZDoom wiki. I studied and learned from 
countless others in the process of making this, and am extremely appreciative to all of them.

	 - flames improved (better coloration for imp fireball flames, more realistic physics, better sizes, more 
	    randomization in duration and size)
	 - imp fireballs improved (no more particles spawning ahead of the actual fireball)
	 - plasma blasts given a whiter light compared to the projectiles leading up to them
	 - water improved (two additional layers added moving in opposite directions)
